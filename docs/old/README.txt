This directory contains a report for the original project at Caltech.
With the exception of the Baum-Welch algorithm, all of the code in this 
project has been replaced, and so this report is no longer representative
of the current state of the project. However, this project was born out 
of the older one and thus this report is included here for giving credit
to the other members for inspiring the current work. 

A lot of the report contains features that were handcrafted to the domain
of poetry, e.g. we attempted to generate couplets etc. However, when creating
the new project I decided  to generate poems that are purely representative 
of the HMM without using any domain specific knowledge. This probably reveals
that a HMM is not capable of writing coherant poetry, but I suppose that
is the best the model can do.
