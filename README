This is a project for CS 155 at Caltech on generating Shakespearean sonnets 
using Hidden Markov Models. 

	The code has been refactored and the directory tree has been restructured 
	by Dryden Bouamalay. 

	Original contributors to the project were: Ritwik Anand, Audrey Huang, and 
	Dryden Bouamalay.

	Project Structure: 
		data/     Contains pickles of trained observation and transition 
		          matrices, etc., as well as the text of Shakespearean sonnets 
		          used to train.
		docs/     Contains a final report summarizing the results of the project 
		          as well as the plots generated for visual analysis. 
		poems/    Contains poems generated by the trained hidden markov models.
		src/      Contains the Python code used to train the hidden markov 
		          models and generate the poems.
