This project was originally a project at Caltech for CS 155 for generating Shakespearean 
sonnets using Hidden Markov Models. 

	The project as a whole is currently being restructured and changed by Dryden Bouamalay. 
	
	Contributors to the originals project were: Ritwik Anand, Audrey Huang, and 
	Dryden Bouamalay.

	Project Structure: 
		data/     Contains pickles of trained observation and transition 
		          matrices, etc., as well as the text of Shakespearean sonnets 
		          used to train.
		docs/     Contains a final report summarizing the results of the project 
		          as well as the plots generated for visual analysis. 
		poems/    Contains poems generated by the trained hidden markov models.
		src/      Contains the Python code used to train the hidden markov 
		          models and generate the poems.
